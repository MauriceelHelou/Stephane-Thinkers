# Backend API URL
# ---------------
# Development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001

# Railway: Set to your Railway backend URL, e.g.:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app

# ===========================================
# Railway Deployment Notes
# ===========================================
# IMPORTANT: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is baked into the build!
#
# On Railway, you must:
# 1. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL as a build argument in the Dockerfile
# 2. OR set it in Railway environment variables before building
# 3. Redeploy the frontend if the backend URL changes
#
# The build command in Railway should have:
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app
